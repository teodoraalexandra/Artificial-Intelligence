Note: In this implementation, we assume the input is a 2d numpy array for simplicity, because that's
how our MNIST images are stored. This works for us because we use it as the first layer in our
network, but most CNNs have many more Conv layers. If we were building a bigger network that needed
to use Conv3x3 multiple times, we'd have to make the input be a 3d numpy array.
